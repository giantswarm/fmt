# Naming Resources

Whenever possible we name azure resources with lowercase alphanumeric
characters split by dashes, e.g. `abc12-sg`. When there are restrictions
preventing us from using dashes we use only alphanumeric characters.

Naming restrictions can be found in this document
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions.
