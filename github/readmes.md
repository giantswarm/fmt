# Project Readme and Description

Projects must have a description and a readme that explains what it is for and where it fits in to the big picture.

Some indication of what other services it collaborates with, what kind of storage, data structures or CRD's it depends on would be good to have in the README as well.

Depending on how 'far up the stack' they are, they can have usage examples.

If it is a tool that we make public, then usage examples are a must.
