# TODO Comments

When writing a TODO in code, create a TODO issue (see
https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/new?template=todo.md) and link
it in the code.

This helps ensure that TODOs don't die in the codebase, but are actioned by
SIGs.

```
// TODO: Remove the foobar once the jank is lollobazzed.
//
//	https://github.com/giantswarm/giantswarm/issues/9001
//
```
